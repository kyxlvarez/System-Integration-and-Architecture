# System-Integration-and-Architecture

In this course Introduction to System Integration and Architecture, I expect to learn how computers and systems are integrated. I also want to know how software and hardware communicate with each other. I also believe this course will enable me to realize how systems are applied at school, in the workplace, and even in everyday life.

Performing hands-on work will make it much easier for me to learn the subjects, and it will also be enjoyable. I think that this topic will also enhance my problem-solving and teamwork abilities, as system integration often involved collaborating with people.

I hope this topic will provide me with knowledge that I can apply in the future. If I pursue a career in technology, what I learn here will definitely come in handy. I would like to gain knowledge and skills that I can use not only in school but also in real life.
